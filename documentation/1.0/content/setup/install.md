Download the latest WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI (WKT UI) application installers from the [Github Releases section](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui/releases) of this repository.
Simply run the appropriate installer for your operating system.

Initial launch of the application displays a thorough "Introduction" to the WKT UI. Step through
it or dismiss it; you can peruse it at any time using `Help > Show Introduction`.
