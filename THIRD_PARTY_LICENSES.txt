   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
   perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works
   in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,

   only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
   necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
   of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
   Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
   and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
        copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
        the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
   without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above,
   nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
   agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
   assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
   License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
   to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
   the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
   for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
   any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
   for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
   only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
   for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.

   that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
   revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,

   License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
   from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work
   and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
   version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
   behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
   perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works
   in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
   in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
   only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
   necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
   of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
   Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
   and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
        copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
        the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and

        in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

   nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
   agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
   assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
   License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
   to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
   the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
   for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
   any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
   for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
   only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
   for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
     if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
     compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
     Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
     Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
     ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
     come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
     Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
     notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
     first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
     from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
     Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
     end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
     have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *

*                                                                      *

jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
